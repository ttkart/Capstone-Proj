# Overall Research Project
Predicting customer ticket prices for domestic flights based on departure cities vs arrival cities 

> We're studying how much it costs for people to fly from city to city within U.S.

> Our goal is to figure out why ticket prices vary based on the cities people are flying to and from.

> This research helps us predict how much domestic flight tickets cost, which is important for the travel and aviation industries.

# Abstract
The research aims to predict domestic flight ticket prices based on departure and arrival cities within the United States. This study addresses the variability in domestic ticket prices and its influencing factors. It employs hyperparameter tuning to optimize our chosen machine-learning regression models. These methods enhance the model performance and computational efficiency by exploring hyperparameter spaces effectively. Ultimately, our project contributions reflect valuable insights for predicting airline ticket costs, benefiting both the consumer and airline industries through the addition of crucial variables including and not limited to domestic air fuel costs, weather conditions, etc.
